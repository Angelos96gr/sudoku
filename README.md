This is an Sudoku webapp. 

The app currently supports the following features:

- A grid of 9 x 9 cells with a variable number of hidden cells (currently the level of difficulty cannot be chosen by the user and there are 30-40 entries to be filled in)
- Recording of how long the game is on for, the number of attempts and mistakes
- The user can select to reset (clear all entries of the current game) or restart (generate a new sudoku puzzle)
- There are certain user input validation such as not registering special keyboard keys or characters
